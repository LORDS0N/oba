        <h3>Principlese of Human Computer Interaction </h3>
<p> Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is the field of study focused on the design and use of computer technology,
     emphasizing the interfaces between people (users) and computers. The principles of HCI are foundational guidelines 
     that help designers and developers create systems that are user-friendly, efficient, and enjoyable to use.</p>

     <!--Application-->
     <h4>Applying HCI pronciples </h4>
     <p>To apply these principles, it is essential to:</p>
     <ul>
        <li><b><u>Conduct User Research:</u></b> Understading the target users, their tasks, and the context in which they will use the system</li>
        <li><b><u>Prototype and Test:</u></b>Create prototypes of the interface and conduct usablity testing to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.</li>
        <li><b><u>Iterate:</u></b>Use the feedback to refine and improve the design iteratively.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>By adhering to these principles, designers and developers can create interface that are more intuitive, accessible, and efffective, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>
