    <h3>Principles of Website Development </h3>
    <p> Millions of websites are built on daily basis, so more 
      emphasis is now given to the principles of good website design. 
      Following these standard principles is important as it allows 
      every websitethe oppurtuinity to be successful in a market which
      is very 
      competitive. When you combine these principles of good design 
      with elements of innovation and creativity, your website has 
      every chance of being successful. In terms of business, if you
      get the website right, the business is more likely to succeed.
      <ul>
        <li><u><b>Usability</u></b>- This is the ease of use of a  
        website, that is, how user-friendly it is. For example, an 
          important element ofwebsite usability is ensuring that 
          website content is flexibleand works on all browsers and 
          devices. </li><br>
        <li><u><b>White space/spacing</u></b>-This is the space on web
          pages that is left untouched and white. Webiste developers 
          utilise white space to separate design elements such as 
          text, graphics and other elements. Unless you utilise 
          spacing, your
          web pages will look cluttered and messy, and it would be 
          hard for visitors to  interpret which words relate to which 
          images 
          and understand what they are looking at.Therefore, when 
          designing a web page,it is crucial to use spacing between 
          elements so as not to overwhelm and confuse website users. 
        </li><br>
        <li><u><b>Site layout</u></b>- This means giving consideration 
          to where  elements go on a web page and how content will be 
          spread across a website. For example, where the header, 
          navigation links, text and graphics will appear on the page. 
          The layout used for one web page should be consistently used
          across all the pages on a website, where similar content is 
          being included. For example, headers should be positioned in
          the same way on all pages. A good site layout is one that is
          uncomplicated, has clear navigation and is intuitive and 
          user-
          friendly.</li><br>
        <li><u><b>Accessbility</u></b>- Website developers must ensure 
          that 
          websites are correctly designed and developed to enable all 
          users to 
          have equal access to information. This is important as it 
          removes 
          barriers that would otherwise prevent a person with 
          dissablities from
          using a website. The BBC is an example of a website that
          provides 
          excellent website accessiblity. It includes features that 
          advise users
          on how to customise their computer set-up and remove 
          barriers to using
          the website. People with poor vision can change the font 
          size and 
          colour. In addition, it provides accessible games for 
          children with
          motor and cognititve disabilities.<br><b>Alexa Traffic 
          Rank</b>
          consistently rates for BBC website in the top 100 websites 
          worldwide.
          One for ths is the excellent way that it caters for all 
          users. </li><br>
          <li><u><b>Navigation</b></u>- It is important that users can
            navigate 
            their way easily around a website. The navigation must be 
            intuitive 
            and simple to use. Good navigation on websites involves
            making it 
            obvious where website links are and being consistent 
            across the 
            whole website. There should be an intuitive structure of 
            pages.
          </li><br>
          <li><u><b>Typography</b></u>- The typeof font used on 
            websites is 
            important. Websites need to have clear and legible text in
            order to 
            be user-friendly and accessible. There are two main types 
            of font 
            families: <b>serif</b> and <b>sans serif</b>. Most 
            websites utilise
            a sans serif font such as Arial because they have no 
            embellishments
            to the letters, making them clearer and easier to read.
          </li><br>
          <li><u><b>Alignment</b></u>- Alignment is how elements are 
            positioned 
            on a web page and how they interact with each other. For
            example, if
            you place an image on a web page which is aligned to the
            left and 
            the supporting text was aligned to the right of the page,
            this would
            suggest to users that there is no re;ationship between the
            two 
            elements, whereas, if they were both aligned left, there
            would 
            appear to be a conectin betwen the two elements.</li><br>
          <li><u><b>Clarity</b></u>- Clarity,being clear, is key to
            good website
            design. It is pointless choosimg a visually appealing
            design if 
            users cannot understand it because it is not clear. 
            Therefore, any 
            website you develop must communicate what you want it to
            say 
            clearly, but also have clarity of design and layout. For 
            example, if 
            you want a user to contact you, you should provide a 
            visible email 
            address or phone number. Asking users to fill in forms 
            takes 
            additional time and does not put the user first. Good
            design 
            matters, but good communication matters more. </li>
          <li><u><b>Consistency</b></u>- Consistency means keeping 
            elements 
            within your website the same throughout. This is 
            considered one of 
            the most important principles in website design. Website 
            consistency
            involbes using the same page layout, the same font and the
            same 
            design and colour scheme, throughout. An incosistent 
            website is 
            unintuitive and difficult to navigate.</li>
          <li><u><b>Accuracy</b></u>- Everything included in the 
            website needs 
            to be accurate: that is, it should be correct and 
            meaningful. To 
            keep 
            information accurate and current. Websites should be 
            updated 
            regularly. Moreover, it is important that the information
            provided 
            on websites is cheecked for factual errors as well as 
            spelling and 
            gramatical mistakes.</li>
          <li><u><b>Content</b></u>- The content of the website 
            includes the 
            text, graphics(diagrams, artworks and photos) as well as
            media and 
            objects. Content needs to be accurate, consistent in 
            style(where 
            appropriate), and you need to ensure that you have 
            permission to use 
            any content that you did not create from scratch.</li>
          <li><u><b>Media and objects</b></u>- Some websites includes 
            interactive content, such as videos, background sounds, 
            Flash images 
            and 
            applets. Media elements are used to captivate and grab the
            attention 
            of website users. The use of media must be appropriate as
            its 
            overuse can slow down a website, clutter the appearance of
            web pages 
            and put off some users. </li>
          <li><u><b>Simplicity</b></u>- Websites which are 
            straightforward in their 
            design are often the most visited. They manage to combine 
            the content they 
            need to get across with a clear and simple, easy-to-use 
            design that 
            attracts
            users back because they know they will get what they need 
            from it without 
            fuss. It is important when developing a website that you 
            do not
            overcomplicate 
            the design by introducing too many elements on the pages. </li>
