    <p> I am a first year Level 3 BTEC computing student studying at 
      Bromley College. This unit is the last unit i am studying for this
      year and it is called Webiste development and unit code is Unit 15.
      <br><br>
      In this unit, I will be developing an interactive blog that will 
      consist of the home, contact us and about us page which will be the 
      evidence that I understand this unit.  
      <br><br>
        I personally like this unit because it entails the practical part
        of computing which is the coding aspect and the fact that I can see
        the result of the code that i've written is fascinating.
